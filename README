Objeck is an object-oriented computer language with functional features. The language has ties with Java, Scheme and UML. In this language all data types, except for higher-order functions, are treated as objects.

The language contains all of the features of a general-purpose computing language with an emphasis placed on simplicity. The programming environment consists of a compiler, virtual machine and command line debugger.
